# Personal LeetCode Practice
Just record some of my personal LeetCode practice answers

Some are in Python3 while some are in C++, this is because I suddently realized that sometimes they may force you to use Python3.

Those answers may not be the best, but can pass all the testcases up to now (11/04/2023).
